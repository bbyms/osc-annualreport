            I studied mechanics for three years before getting my first job in a car repair shop. After a few years, my
            boss
            told me I could not get a raise because, as a woman, I could not be earning more than men. I resigned and
            found
            a job with WFP, where I have been working since 2007. Since then I do feel treated as an equal and it is
            really
            rewarding.

                    SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 2018, WFP was asked to optimize the supply chain of India’s Public Distribution System, a
                    national safety net that reaches more than <strong class="text-success">800 million</strong> Indians
                    with a monthly allowance of cereals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A proof of concept was developed for Dhenkenal district, in Odisha state, where the Public
                    Distribution System assists <strong class="text-success">928,000 beneficiaries</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WFP reviewed the various parts of the supply chain to identify inefficiencies and suggest
                    alternative setups. One of the identified issues is that most of the cereal allocations are made
                    based on administrative boundaries, which means that a warehouse in a specific suburb will be
                    connected by default to all the mills and the delivery points in that suburb, even if other
                    locations are physically closer. This results in higher transport costs and a less efficient supply
                    chain.

                            This is what the network currently looks like, with several delivery points supplied by
                            multiple warehouses that are not necessarily even the nearest ones

                    Food procurement’s primary purpose is to procure the right food at the right time, in the right

                    and at the

                    The Food Procurement Unit is responsible for buying commodities locally, regionally and
                    internationally.
                    Procurement experts in country offices, regional bureaux and headquarters develop and maintain
                    shortlists of
                    qualified suppliers to source commodities, including complex commodities, such as fortified cereals,
                    which are
                    increasingly used in WFP food baskets.

                </p>
                <p>
                    By procuring food fortified with essential micronutrients, WFP is not only fighting hunger but also

                    health
                    implications of malnutrition. For example, WFP is actively contributing to rice fortification in 16
                    countries
                    through a successful collaboration between the Nutrition and Supply Chain Divisions.

                <p>
                    In collaboration with other WFP functions, including Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) and
                    Programme, as well as with external stakeholders, Food Procurement uses market intelligence to
                    develop
                    sourcing strategies which define the optimal time to buy the different commodities in various
                    locations.
