                    UNHRD is a network of six hubs located in Ghana, Italy, Malaysia, Panama, Spain and the United Arab
                    Emirates that procures, manages and transports emergency supplies for the humanitarian community.

                    UNHRD is a one stop shop for partners, offering free storage, procurement, transport, and cargo
                    handling, as well as the HRD Field Team, which is available on call and at the onset of an
                    emergency. The Field Team helps organizations set up equipment, consolidate cargo, manage non-food
                    items and train local staff.

                    UNHRD also hosts the LAB, a research and development unit that reviews, tests and helps develop
                    innovative solutions and products for supply chain operations. It aims to improve logistics support
                    equipment and provide solutions for reducing waste from relief items packaging.
