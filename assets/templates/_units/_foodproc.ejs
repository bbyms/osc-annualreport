                    Food procurementâ€™s primary purpose is to procure the right food at the right time, in the right
                    place
                    and at the
                    lowest possible price to supply WFP beneficiaries.

                    The Food Procurement Unit is responsible for buying commodities locally, regionally and
                    internationally.
                    Procurement experts in country offices, regional bureaux and headquarters develop and maintain
                    shortlists of
                    qualified suppliers to source commodities, including complex commodities, such as fortified cereals,
                    which are
                    increasingly used in WFP food baskets.

                </p>
                <p>
                    By procuring food fortified with essential micronutrients, WFP is not only fighting hunger but also
                    the
                    health
                    implications of malnutrition. For example, WFP is actively contributing to rice fortification in 16
                    countries
                    through a successful collaboration between the Nutrition and Supply Chain Divisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In collaboration with other WFP functions, including Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) and
                    Programme, as well as with external stakeholders, Food Procurement uses market intelligence to
                    develop
                    sourcing strategies which define the optimal time to buy the different commodities in various
                    locations.

                <p class="lead">
                    Procurement of food increased by <strong class="text-primary">64 percent</strong> between 2014 and
                    2018,
                    mainly driven by large scale emergencies such as Syria, Yemen and South Sudan.

                    Market prices are continually updated to avoid any adverse impact on local markets, while a
                    stringent
                    vendor
                    vetting system is in place to ensure fairness, transparency and accountability.
