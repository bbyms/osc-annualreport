                            During sudden onset emergencies, air transport is often the fastest way to reach affected
                            populations. UNHAS enables first responders to provide immediate life-saving assistance and
                            ensures timely delivery of relief supplies to avert loss of life and or deterioration of the
                            humanitarian situation.

                    UNHAS also performs medical evacuations and security relocation for aid workers. Following the two
                    Ebola breakouts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UNHAS promptly deployed customized
                    helicopters to transport health personnel and biological samples, and to serve as evacuation
                    capacity for suspected patients.
