                    In South Sudan, delivery modalities to deep-field locations were optimized, decreasing the need for
                    airdrops and thereby reducing costs. Also, the delivery network and the corridor utilization for
                    prepositioning were optimized.

                        Supply chain planning is a magic ball which ensures a cost-effective and efficient operation in the country. Whilst we have had to deliver more food assistance than before, we have been able to make substantial reductions in both the delivery costs and lead times, ensuring help gets to the maximum number of people in need.‚Äù
