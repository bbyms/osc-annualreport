                                        Good storage facilities and solid warehouse management are integral components
                                        of WFP supply chain and crucial to the ability to deliver food and non-food
                                        assistance.
                                </p>

                                        WFP uses many different types of warehouse facilities. Some are permanent
                                        structures, others are temporary and deployed to serve immediate emerging needs
                                        following emergencies, or to be close to the final distribution points.

                                </p>

                                        WFP staff are trained in setting up mobile storage units, as well as in managing
                                        stocks effectively to ensure the quality of all stored items and minimize
                                        losses.
