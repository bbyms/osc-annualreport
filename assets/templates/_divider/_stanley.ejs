                        I have on more than three occasions slept on the road when my truck got stuck in the mud or when
                        the roads were impassable due to poor conditions. But I’m always inspired every time I arrive at
                        a school to deliver food for school meals. I’m welcomed by children joyfully shouting ‘Porridge!
                        Porridge! Porridge!”
