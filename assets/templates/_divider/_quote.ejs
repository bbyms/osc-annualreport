            I studied mechanics for three years before getting my first job in a car repair shop. After a few years, my
            boss
            told me I could not get a raise because, as a woman, I could not be earning more than men. I resigned and
            found
            a job with WFP, where I have been working since 2007. Since then I do feel treated as an equal and it is
            really
            rewarding.
