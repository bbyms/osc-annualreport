                    <q>
                        I studied mechanics for three years before getting my first job in a car repair shop. After a
                        few years, my
                        boss
                        told me I could not get a raise because, as a woman, I could not be earning more than men. I
                        resigned and
                        found
                        a job with WFP, where I have been working since 2007. Since then I do feel treated as an equal
                        and it is
                        really
                        rewarding.
