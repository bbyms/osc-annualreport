          <p class="quote">
            I studied mechanics for three years before getting my first job in a
            car repair shop. After a few years, my boss told me I could not get
            a raise because, as a woman, I could not be earning more than men. I
            resigned and found a job with WFP, where I have been working since
            2007. Since then I do feel treated as an equal and it is really
            rewarding.”
